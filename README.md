# Kalki Umboxes

This repository has several components that are needed for building umbox. In particular:

- **alerter**: Python-based module that looks for alerts in logfiles inside an umbox, and send alerts to the Control node.
- **sniffer**: Python-based packet analyzer software that has several sample functionalities that can be used to showcase
things that umboxes can do.
- **umboxes**: specific and common configuration files to create either VM or container based umboxes.

Please see the readmes in each subfolder for more details.
